# Sqaure-Triangle-

Greetings,

This is an app I made to check if a number is a Square and/or a Triangular number.
Neat.
Square Number: https://thirdspacelearning.com/blog/what-is-a-square-number/
Triangular Number: https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-are-triangular-numbers-definition-formula-examples.html

Regards :)
